# Dropshelf

Welcome to the issue-only repo for Dropshelf. Dropshelf is a drag and drop utility for Windows that makes moving and copying files easier and faster. Shake your mouse to open up shelves, which let you stash and hold draggable content until you need it. Dropshelf uses the Windows App SDK and WinUI 3 framework.
